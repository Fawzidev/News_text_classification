Most people consider acne a teenage problem, but the truth is that this common skin condition can continue well into your 20s, 30s and even 40s.

From hormones to genetics to your skincare regime, adult acne can be triggered by many factors, including what you eat.

Dr Douglas Grose, President of the Cosmetic Physicians College of Australasia (CPCA) said it's important to consider diet and lifestyle when treating acne.

'For just about as long as I have been a medical practitioner, which is about 48 years, the medical profession has denied the importance of diet when it comes to treating acne,' he said.

'In recent years, however, the evidence is mounting showing an association between the two.

'Research is demonstrating that acne is a disease among Western society and is noticeably absent in those that consume Palaeolithic diets that don't consist of refined sugars, grains, milk and dairy products,' he added.

According to dietitian Melanie McGrice, acne sufferers should avoid sugary, highly processed foods like soft drinks, sugary breakfast cereals, hot chips and white bread.

'Acne is caused more often by hormones than by eating the wrong foods, however, recent research suggests that eating too many foods with a high GI can worsen acne,' she said.

Dr Grose said when it comes to acne, carbohydrates can be the enemy.

Any food that typically comes from grains such as bread, pasta, cereals, biscuits and cake as well as animal-based milk products should avoided for acne-prone skin, according to Dr Grose.

'High carbohydrates stimulate production of a hormone called insulin growth factor 1, and also cause problems with testosterone levels in the bloodstream,' he said.

'The combination of the two stimulates the oil glands and also tends to make the skin thicken up causing blockage and hence, acne.'

While Dr Grose said that the first step in reducing acne is limiting carbohydrates and animal-based milk products (or having none at all), there are also treatments that can assist, including LED light phototherapy, Intense Pulse Light (IPL), laser, microdermabrasions, AHA/BHA masks and chemical peels.

He also said topical products containing Benzoyl peroxide can help, as can minimising the use of heavy makeup.

'These topical formulations are very good to put on the skin in the morning or at night as the aim is to unclog the pores. I say to patients, once your pores are draining, you're never going to get acne.

'As long as the oils are being eliminated from the skin, you will be acne free,' said Dr Grose.
