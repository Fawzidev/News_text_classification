Vulnerable pensioners are being left with crippling care bills because of a postcode lottery which sees them denied vital NHS funding, research has found.

Patients with serious health problems, including many with dementia, are meant to receive free help through the NHS Continuing Healthcare Fund.

However, some areas are 25 times less likely to offer access to the NHS money than others, according to a survey by Which?.

The only hope patients have of receiving free care is by persuading CCGs that their needs are so severe that they require continuing care funds

This means thousands of elderly people – and their families – are being handed huge social care bills they must pay themselves.

The South Reading clinical commissioning group (CCG) paid for care for the lowest proportion of people at 8.78 patients per 50,000 head of population, while Salford in Greater Manchester funded 220.38 per 50,000.

Although CCGs may differ demographically, this cannot easily explain the regional variation. South Reading, for example, benchmarked itself against the ten most similar CCGs and found one, Leeds North, was funding nine times as many patients.

Under England’s care system, the elderly have to pay the full cost of their care down to their last £23,500.

Ministers have pledged a cap on the amount to be paid – but this will not be introduced for several years.

The only hope patients have of receiving free care is by persuading CCGs that their needs are so severe that they require continuing care funds.

Officials are supposed to use the national framework to ensure patients are treated in the same way wherever they live, but the Which? survey found a huge postcode lottery in whether the NHS will pay.

One of the areas with the lowest funding levels was Wokingham, Berkshire, which covers many of Theresa May’s own constituents.

Which? cited the case of Gill Jarvis, who faced £96,000-a-year bills after her mother – who has severe dementia – had her funding suddenly withdrawn.

She said: ‘My mum’s needs have actually worsened. I’ve been given no real explanation and the lack of humanity has hit me quite hard.’

A Which? spokesman said ministers should examine the care system as a whole, including how quality varies by region, in a forthcoming green paper. He added: ‘Whether you get funding for care shouldn’t depend on where you live.’

Although the Department of Health insists there are no caps or quotas on access, NHS England’s efficiency plan asks CCGs to save £855million on continuing care by 2020-21.

A new national framework, aiming to offer greater clarity on funding criteria, will be implemented on October 1.
