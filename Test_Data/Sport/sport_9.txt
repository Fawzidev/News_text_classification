ATLETICO MADRID were thumped by Real Sociedad to leave Barcelona on the brink of the La Liga title.

Juanmi came off the bench to score twice in the 3-0 win - as Diego Simeone's suffered their third defeat in the last four away games, just a week before travelling to Arsenal for the Europa League semi-final first-leg.

Atletico remain 12 points behind Barca - who can now win the La Liga title against Deportivo La Coruna next weekend.

Willlian Jose opened the scoring in the first half after the visitors were caught on the back-foot as Adnan Januzaj charged down the wing.

The ex-Manchester United star pulled the ball back to Jose, who sent the ball confidently into the back of the net from the penalty spot.

Atletico had a goal disallowed in the second half after Sime Vrsaljko saw his headed effort ruled out as Hector Moreno was fouled in the process.

Juanmi was then introduced from the sidelines in the 72nd minute to replace Mikel Oyarzabal.

And he doubled the tally after just eight minutes with a sublime lofted strike that flew over Jan Oblak and into the corner of the net.

Fernando Torres came close to pulling one back for the visitors, but his headed effort was confidently dealt with by Geronimo Rulli.

Imanol Alguacil's side were persistent until the final whistle, which allowed Juanmi to bag his brace in stoppage time.
