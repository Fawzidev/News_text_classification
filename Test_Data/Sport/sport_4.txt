BESIKTAS boss Senol Gunes had his head split open by objects thrown from the stands as the Turkish Cup semi-final at Fenerbahce was abandoned.

Gunes needed stitches and his assistant, Erdinc Gultekin, was left with a bloodied face after a furious tunnel bust-up between both sets of players and staff from the Istanbul rivals.

Gunes dropped to the floor and clutched his head in agony in the 58th minute of the Turkish Cup semi-final second leg as what appeared to be a SEAT was launched at him.

Officials helped him up but, as he was taken down the tunnel for treatment, ANOTHER object struck him and he collapsed.

Gunes, 65 - who has worked as a manager for 30 years including four in charge of the Turkish national team - had his head wound STAPLED in the dressing room before being rushed to hospital.

Distressing pictures show him being wheeled through a corridor in a hospital bed.

Riot police were on hand for the fiery derby and marched onto the pitch in a desperate bid to restore order.

At least 15 Fenerbahce fans were arrested as cops made their way into the stands to find offenders, according to local reports.

Players and staff from both teams clashed in the tunnel as Gunes received treatment in the dressing room.

There were nasty scenes on the pitch too as former Real Madrid defender Pepe was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge.

Besiktas keeper Tolga Zengin was arguing with Fenerbahce fans before the object was launched in his direction, but hit boss Gunes instead.

Zengin, 34, apparently hit out after being taunted about his late mother.

Fenerbahce could now face a stadium ban.

The tie was balanced at 2-2 from a heated first leg, with Alvaro Negredo and Anderson Talisca netting for Besiktas while Robeto Soldado and Sener Ozbayrakli grabbed Fenerbahces' goals.

Alper Potuk was sent off for Fenerbahce for two yellow cards in the first leg.
