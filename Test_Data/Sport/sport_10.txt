AFTER the first night of the superstar shake-up – with Bobby Roode, Jinder Mahal, Natalya, and Drew McIntyre joining Raw – last night was SmackDown LIVE’s turn.

We already know that The Miz is going to the blue brand, but who else would follow him? Here are five we things we learnt from last night’s show.

WWE Jeff Hardy was the first person on the show to move from Raw to SmackDown

Jeff Hardy has joined SmackDown

The new US Champion Jeff Hard led the final wave of superstars to jump ship when he arrived on SmackDown for a match with Shelton Benjamin.

Hardy pinned Benjamin with a Swanton Bomb, but there was a hint of a future match against Randy Orton, who came out before Hardy’s surprise appearance.

(That’s only fair – Orton did win a shot at the US title on last week’s show.)

Not only has Hardy NOT been brought back as his Broken/Woken alter ego Brother Nero, but now he’s also been separated him from Matt altogether.

Also jumping to SmackDown are Samoa Joe, The Bar, Gallows and Anderson, plus NXT stars Andrade Almas and Sanity.

Samoa Joe wants dream matches with Daniel Bryan, Randy Orton, and AJ Styles

Joe’s SD debut saw him make light work of glorified jobber Sin Cara. Joe choked him out with the Coquina Clutch.

He then cut an intense promo, sneering at SmackDown’s rep as the “land of opportunity” – according to Joe it’s more like the “land of handouts”.

He then teased a series of exciting match-ups, now that the opportunity is all his.

He promised to put Daniel Bryan to sleep, defang Randy Orton, and emasculate and decimate AJ Styles.

Joe was a surprise success story of Raw last year – a case of him taking the ball and seriously running with it – so he could rise to the top of SmackDown fast.

Carmella’s celebration turned into an IIconic brawl

The new SmackDown Women’s Champion held a celebration (or “mellabration”) for her successful cash-in last week.

Predictably, Charlotte Flair interrupted, but surprised Carmella by congratulating her.

Charlotte said she knows the “dirtiest player in the game” (her old man, Ric), and applauded Carmella for seizing the moment.

The IIconics Billie Kay and Peyton Royce then arrived to further mock Charlotte with childish insults.

Any buzz for the duo’s debut last week – which saw them put a savage beat-down on Charlotte – was quickly killed with this painful-to-watch promo.

It turned into yet another brawl when Charlotte started throwing forearms at the IIconics, before Becky Lynch ran out to join Charlotte and even up the numbers.

Following the brawl, Charlotte battled Billie Kay in one-on-one action. But with Becky, Peyton, and Carmella still at ringside, it was only ever going on way.

After Charlotte beat Billie with the Figure-8, Carmella and Peyton jumped her from behind – turning it into a 3-on-2 beat-down.

Help came when Asuka made her surprise SmackDown debut. She smashed her way through the IIconics and stood alongside her WrestleMania opponent Charlotte.

It’s the right move for Asuka. She’s done everything she can do on Raw (short of winning the title) and this will reinvigorate her after taking her first loss at Mania.

Carmella should be worried for her newly won title. With both Charlotte and Asuka on the blue brand, Carmella will be lucky to hold onto the belt for long.

Big Cass has returned – and attacked Daniel Bryan

WWE Nakamura surprises AJ with a(nother) low blow

Last week’s dream match between AJ Styles and Daniel Bryan became a dream team last night, when they faced Rusev and Aiden English in tag competition.

It turned into a nightmare though when Shinsuke Nakamura sneak attacked AJ with yet another low blow (that’s three and counting).

But the big news – and we do mean BIG – was the return of 7-footer Cass, who jumped into the ring and nailed Bryan with a big boot.

He’d already been seen backstage earlier in the night, mocking Bryan’s height.

With the likes of Styles, Samoa Joe, Nakamura, The Miz, Jeff Hardy, and Andrade Almas on the SD roster, Big Cass is the last person we want to see feuding with Bryan.

Is WWE really about to get in completely wrong with Bryan again?
