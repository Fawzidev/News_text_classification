KURT ANGLE has dropped a huge hint a dream match between Bobby Lashley and Brock Lesnar could be in the offing.

Lashley returned to Raw last week after a ten-year absence from WWE.

During his time away from the company he worked for fellow wrestling promotion TNA before entering the world of MMA.

The 41-year-old won 15 of his 17 fights inside the cage and his accomplishments have many believing he is the only viable contender to overcome the current Universal Title holder.

Lesnar, a former world UFC heavyweight champ, has destroyed all before him since his own comeback in WWE back in 2012.

Speculation has been rife that Lashley and Lesnar are planned to meet in a bumper showdown at SummerSlam in August.

And now Raw general manager Angle, who has both men signed to his roster, has hinted that could happen after admitting he would love to see the two giants go head-to-head inside the squared-circle.

Speaking to USA Today about Lashley’s return, Angle said: “That surprised me. I literally didn’t even know about him discussing anything with the company.

“Bobby was a guy that was overlooked years back. He came into his own at Impact Wrestling.

“He proved that he’s an incredible sports entertainer, but Bobby was also, you know… he always wanted to be a pro wrestler. He wanted to be a sports entertainer.

“He didn’t necessarily want to be a fighter, but he had to fight to make some great money. So he did what he had to do to provide for his family by being in Bellator.

“Not that he didn’t enjoy it, but he had more of a love for sports entertainment than he did MMA.”

Angle added: “I’m glad he’s on Raw. I wrestled him many times – I beat him for the world title, he beat me.

“We had some great matches, and I know he’s capable of doing it. I think one of the matches I’d really be intrigued to see is him versus Brock.”

Whether Lesnar, 40, is still the title holder at the summer’s biggest party remains to be seen.

The Beast will defend his title against Roman Reigns, who he defeated at WrestleMania last week, in a Steel Cage match at the Greatest Royal Rumble in Saudi Arabia on Friday 27 April.
