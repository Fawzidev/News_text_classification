AMIR KHAN says Saul Alvarez will always be remembered as a drugs cheat.

The Mexican superstar, 27, was this week given a six-month ban for doping.

But Canelo — who twice tested positive for fat-stripping drug clenbuterol — can return to the ring in September.

And the two-weight world champ is even using his time out to recover from knee surgery before what is expected to be a titanic rematch with Gennady Golovkin.

Yet Khan, who was knocked out cold by Canelo in 2016, insists the Mexican’s legacy is tainted for ever.

The Bolton star, 31, said: “People will always remember Canelo as a cheat.

“The six-month suspension doesn’t mean anything.

“Other fighters will see that and think, ‘I can take anything to get jacked up and only have a six-month ban’.

“Six months is barely one fight, he’ll be straight back into a massive fight again.

“I hoped it would be more serious, a longer ban, to make sure that other fighters won’t follow. Life bans or at least a couple of years.

“He’s then had surgery during the ban so he will come back feeling even better.

“When you get caught you will always be known as a cheat and you will never get that same respect. We don’t know if he has been doing it all his career.”

Khan has not fought since being destroyed by Alvarez after stepping up to middleweight two years ago.

But he makes his comeback tomorrow, meeting Canadian Phil Lo Greco in a catchweight contest in Liverpool.

Former world light-welterweight king Khan still has hopes of ruling the 147lb welterweight division.

He added: “I have been fighting for more than ten years and I have never thought about taking anything.

“I am a clean fighter, I can always have my head up high. But others out there will know they have cheated deep down.”
