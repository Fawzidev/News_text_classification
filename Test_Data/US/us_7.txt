On the list of possible midair emergencies, airline passengers are instructed on every flight what to do if the cabin pressure suddenly drops. “If the airplane loses pressure, oxygen masks will drop automatically,” the safety video on American Airlines flights says. “The yellow cup goes around your mouth and nose.”

But selfies and videos snapped on Tuesday by passengers on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, which suffered an engine explosion and depressurization that caused the masks to fall, are proof that the safety warnings before takeoff are not always heeded. The photos show panicked passengers with the yellow oxygen masks around their mouths but not their noses.

Immediately after the engine exploded, throwing shrapnel into the side of the plane and fatally wounding one passenger, many of the passengers believed the airplane was going to crash. Their minds raced to how they could say goodbye to loved ones. Whether their masks were on properly was not a priority, some said later.

Timothy C. Bourman, 36, a pastor from Woodside, N.Y., whose wife, Amanda, was scrambling to get a message to their three daughters, said he could not figure out how to use his mask and quickly gave up trying. “I wasn’t having trouble breathing,” he said Thursday.
