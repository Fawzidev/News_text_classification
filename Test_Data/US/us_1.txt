Judge Vance’s son, Robert S. Vance Jr., himself a judge in Alabama, said Thursday that he had not forgiven Mr. Moody because “he has not acknowledged any remorse or any acknowledgment that he was guilty.”

“I’m not a psychiatrist, but if you’re talking about using labels like psychopath, this seems to be the kind of person that would fit that description because of absolute lack of empathy or concern for others,” Judge Vance said.

Mr. Moody was pronounced dead at 8:42 p.m. on Thursday inside a South Alabama prison, ending a generations-long legal drama that began in 1972, when he planned a bombing against an automobile dealer who had repossessed his car.

His unsuccessful efforts to have his conviction overturned in that case stirred a protracted rage against the 11th Circuit, which has jurisdiction in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, Mr. Moody’s home state. After the 11th Circuit rejected Mr. Moody’s appeal in August 1989, the court noted in a subsequent ruling, he began trying to develop “war gases” and prepared what he termed a “Declaration of War” against the appellate court.

In December 1989, Mr. Moody mailed a parcel with a bomb — steel pipe, smokeless powder and 80 finishing nails — to the suburban Birmingham home of Robert Vance Sr., who had only considered Mr. Moody’s appeal when it was before the full court. The bomb exploded when Judge Vance opened the package, killing him and gravely injuring his wife.

Another bomb two days later killed Robert E. Robinson, an African-American lawyer in Savannah, Ga. Officials also intercepted a device that was sent to the 11th Circuit’s offices in Atlanta, as well as a bomb that was mailed to a Florida office of the N.A.A.C.P.

Prosecutors believed Mr. Moody disguised his motive by using the name of a fictitious group when he vowed to kill judges and railed against African-Americans and the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit’s treatment of them.

Federal officials began to focus on Mr. Moody after an investigator described one of the bombs to a chemist with what was then known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who sketched the device on a napkin and noticed its similarity to one Mr. Moody had built in 1972.

“That’s Moody’s bomb,” the chemist said in an episode Mr. Freeh described in his memoir, which noted that Mr. Moody’s companion ultimately cooperated with investigators and provided crucial information.

Mr. Moody, who attended law school and apparently resented that he could not practice, has maintained his innocence. In a recent letter to Judge Vance, he wrote, “Had my Dad been murdered, I would want to know who had done it.”

Yet federal officials long pointed to a recording, partly transcribed in a court ruling, of Mr. Moody talking to himself in jail after the killings: “Now you’ve killed two. … Now you can’t pull another bombin’.”

“I never came across someone like him: very brilliant, very determined, very skillful,” Mr. Freeh recalled on Thursday, adding, “He made it a campaign to declare war against the courts and kill these innocent people, but I’ve never seen a defendant like that.”

Legal questions that often surface in capital cases were not at issue on Thursday as Mr. Moody’s execution neared. There were not, for example, last-minute questions about his competency or Alabama’s reliance on a lethal injection protocol that includes midazolam, a sedative whose use in executions has been bitterly disputed.

Instead, Mr. Moody’s final efforts to avoid execution, which the United States Supreme Court rejected, were largely procedural, including whether the federal government could turn him over to Alabama — and its execution chamber — while Mr. Moody served his federal sentence of seven life terms, plus 400 years. (The federal case included charges connected to the bombs sent to Judge Vance and Mr. Robinson. Mr. Freeh, who prosecuted the federal case at Mr. Mueller’s behest, said he believed Mr. Robinson’s killing was intended “to create a diversion” to distract investigators.)

The Justice Department said Mr. Sessions, Alabama’s attorney general when Mr. Moody was tried in state court, had determined that the federal government did not object to Mr. Moody being in Alabama’s custody “for purposes of carrying out the capital sentence.”

In a plea for clemency to Gov. Kay Ivey, one of Mr. Moody’s lawyers noted that Judge Vance was “by all accounts, an opponent of capital punishment.” On Thursday, the judge’s son acknowledged that his father had expressed reservations about executions.

“But he also made clear that as a judge, he has to follow what the law dictates and put aside his personal views, and he had to do that several times sitting as a judge,” Judge Vance said of his father.

“Moody was tried, convicted by a jury of his peers twice, the final time with the recommendation of the death penalty,” he said. “I think the legal system worked well in getting those convictions.”

Prompted at the prison near the Florida border on Thursday night, Mr. Moody offered no last words.
