Lee Holley, who created an idyllic picture of postwar American teenage life through “Ponytail,” a syndicated cartoon panel and Sunday comic strip that appeared in hundreds of newspapers around the world, died in a plane crash on March 26 in Marina, Calif. He was 85.

His daughter, Karen, confirmed the death in the last week as DNA tests were being performed on the remains. Mr. Holley, an amateur pilot, was flying his single-engine plane when it crashed at Marina’s municipal airport on the morning of the 26th. There were no passengers aboard. Marina is about 10 miles north of Monterey, Calif.

Mr. Holley was an assistant and ghost illustrator for Hank Ketcham’s “Dennis the Menace” comics in 1960 when he conjured up “Ponytail.” In single- and multi-panel comics he depicted a lanky teenage girl immersed in postwar suburban life: cruising in hot rods to drive-in movie theaters and burger joints, attending school football games, negotiating with teachers at Watson Hill High School (about completing her homework), and managing diplomatic concerns with her parents (like the size of her allowance).

Mr. Holley, drawing on his own adolescent years, recognized a growing interest in teen humor comics at the time, perhaps best exemplified by the “Emmy Lou” and “Penny” strips and the “Archie” comic book franchise.

In another, she corners him on the couch to ask for money: “Daddy, I need five dollars … I’m in a hurry, so could you give me your lecture about money TOMORROW?!”

Many of Ponytail’s narratives revolved around dating, with her focus on her main beau, Donald Dawson. By high school hallway lockers she tells him: “Of course I’ll love you forever, Donald … well, at least until someone with a better CAR comes along!”
