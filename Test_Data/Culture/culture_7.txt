If that catchphrase and the robot are all you remember about "Lost in Space" -- and frankly, there's not a whole lot more that's worth recalling -- you should have a pretty good time with the Netflix reboot, which, gives said robot a more menacing, way-cool retrofitting, along with sprucing up other key members of the ensemble.
